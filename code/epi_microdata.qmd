title: "R: Using EPI's CPS Extracts"
---

**Note:** Users will need to install epiextractr for this example. Refer to [EPI built libraries](epi-libraries.qmd) for installation instructions

```{r Load libraries, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(epiextractr)
library(here)
```

```{r Download CPS files from microdata site, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# download CPS ORG files  
download_cps( sample = 'org', extracts_dir = here('data/cps'))

# Users can also download CPS Basic (4085.3 MB) and CPS May (38.8 MB) files 

```

will download the latest EPI CPS ORG extracts in .feather format from [https://microdata.epi.org](https://microdata.epi.org/) and place them in the directory `C:\data\cps`.

After the data is downloaded, load a selection of CPS data for your analysis:

```{r Load ORG, message=FALSE}

org <- load_cps("org", 2020:2022, year, orgwgt, wage, age, statefips, wbho, 
         .extracts_dir = here('data/cps/'))

org

```
